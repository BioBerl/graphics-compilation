# 1.1 MINIMUM CIRCOS CONFIGURATION 
#
# This is a 'hello world' Circos tutorial. 
#
# Only required configuration elements are included.
#
# Subsequent tutorials in this section build on this example to
# generate a representative image with common elements found in Circos
# figures in the literature.



# Chromosome name, size and color definition
karyotype = data/karyotype/karyotype.human.txt


# The <ideogram> block defines the position, size, labels and other
# properties of the segments on which data are drawn. These segments
# are usually chromosomes, but can be any integer axis.

# The remaining content is standard and required. It is imported from
# default files in the Circos distribution.
#
# These should be present in every Circos configuration file and
# overridden as required. To see the content of these files, 
# look in etc/ in the Circos distribution.
#
# It's best to include these files using relative paths. This way, the
# files if not found under your current directory will be drawn from
# the Circos distribution. 
#
# As always, centralize all your inputs as much as possible.
